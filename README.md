Internal character nicknames found in PS3 GENJI (BPAK format)
​I discovered that character data in PS3 GENJI is categorized by internal nicknames within the binary.
By searching for the keyword "Model" inside .BPAK files, you can identify these nicknames (e.g., "SHIZU" for Shizuka-gozen or "YOSSY" for Yoshitsune) and successfully locate the specific character data offsets.
​It's fascinating to see these "dev-team only" nicknames still alive in the code after all these years!
